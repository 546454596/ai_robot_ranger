# Sensor Management Package

## Rules setup
To write a rules file please refer to [this link](http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/ros/Udev%20Rules.html).

Notice that everytime, if any sensor changed or added, modify the rules file under `rules` folder and update the raleted rules in system folder (`/etc/udev/rules.d`)
